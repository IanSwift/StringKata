What I Did:

I started by creating a Calculator class with an injected Parser and Operator class. I mocked these out for
early tests, to get my calculator class working correctly. After I had a fully working Calculator class,
I added implementations of Parser and Operator which performed my calculation, testing each component separately.
Finally, I added an application that repeatedly asked for a string, then tried to add it using the calculator.

What I Did Right:

After my last session, I noticed that there was a bigger focus on the parser in this Kata than anything else.
Accordingly, I put a lot of effort into standardizing the parser. I also noticed in my last session that there
is a separation of actions between parsing and adding. Of course, I broke these apart as well. I also added
an application to run the program.

What I Did Wrong:

I had a couple of tests that were green the first time I ran them. The main point for this was the iteration from
one integer, to two integers, to many integers. I parse it using a string.split() command on the commas. Perhaps
for future efforts, it would be advantageous to write code that ONLY passed the next test, and did not pass
future tests. I also should have done a better job of catching errors, so that if you give a wrong input,
the entire program doesn't crash.
